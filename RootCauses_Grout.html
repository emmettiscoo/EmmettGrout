               <h1>Root Cause 1</h1>
               Systemic Racism has limited economic, educational, and evironmental mobility.
              </div>
              
              <div class="col-7 col-sm-4 border border-5 bg-warning" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                <p>The effect of redlining has created segrated areas within cities which have seperated people based on race and wealth.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 bg-warning" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
              <h2> Explanation</h2>
              <p>Historically privileged neighborhoods are located in more natural settings. E.g: Oakland Hills, Crocker, Berkeley hills, and Piedmont.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-4 col-sm-4 border border-5 bg-warning" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                <p>Malfunding in lower income communities has  further worsed the conditions of those environments.</p>
               </div>
               <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 bg-warning" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2> Explanation</h2>
                <p>Underfunding has lead to reduced access to nature because there are miminal local parks, few public transportation options to these areas, and less education about the environment in school.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-3 border border-5 bg-warning" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>Systemic racism has created a social climate where poor and typically non-white residents are inflicted with the worst symptoms of local climate destruction, while also recieving little help from local minicipalities to either improve environmental conditions, or improve access to outdoor areas.</p>

               <h1>Root Cause 2</h1>
               <p>Uraban expansion has resulted in environmental destruction particularily at a cost to people living in the poorest areas of a city.</p>
              </div>
              
              <div class="col-7 col-sm-4 border border-5 bg-success" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                <p>The replacing of natural habitat with urban sprawl.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 bg-success" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
              <h2> Explanation</h2>
              <p>While the most affluent homes in the Bay Area are often located in areas with ample trees and parks, housing for lower income people is consitently located next to industrial pollution sources like ports and highways.</p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-4 col-sm-4 border border-5 bg-success" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2>Evidence</h2>
                <p>There are minimal trees and parks in poorer neighborhoods.</p> 
              </div>
               <div class="col-4 col-sm-8 border border-5 bg-success" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
                <h2> Explanation</h2>
                <p>The lack of trees worses the effect of air pollution is lower income neighborhoods as there is no natural air filtration.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-3 border border-5 bg-success" style ="--bs-bg-opacity: .3;">
            <h2>Implications</h2>
            <p>The toll of building large urban sprawl (not the houses for the wealthy) has reduced the area of undisturbed natural environment in cities, and the proximity of industry to human populations has increased pollution to those areas which are devoid of natural  or manufactured air filters. rban planning has not priotized protecting the environment or protecting the people who experience the negative effects of poor planning.</p>
