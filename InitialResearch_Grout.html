<!-- STEP TWO: CUSTOMIZE THE LOOK-->
<!-- Make adjustments to the display size, text color, background color, border, text alignment, etc... -->
<!-- Use 4 different types of bootstrap classes -->
<!-- The best way to do this is to search using the navbar. Put in a term OR a class tag -->
<!-- A few pages that should be helpful to start out with.... 
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/content/typography/ to adjust the display (size, etc)
  Use https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/color/ to adjust color attributes 
  (there's also different pages with background color, opacity, etc )-->

        <h2>Problem statement</h2>
        Limited acccess to nature further perpetuates environmental racism.

      <div class="col border - 5 text - success bg-danger bg-gradient">
        <h3>Need statement</h3>
        We need to dedicate more resources into lower income communities that encourage better access to, and education about the environment.

        There are over 73 parks in the east bay.
        Only 3.2% of Alemeda county budget goes into parks.

        <ul>
          <li>Important Data and Ideas: Clean drinking water, clean air, public parks and beaches, biodiversity, and open spaces are shared goods to which every person in the United States has an equal right both in principle and in law</li>
          <li>In communities of color and low-income communities, families have too few safe, close-to-home parks and coastlines where they are able to get outside.</li>
          <li>Redlining, forced migration, and economic segregation are just a few of the unjust policies and forces that have created barriers to, and a gradient of distance from, the United Statesâ€™ remaining natural areas for people of color</li>
          <li>Nature destruction has had the largest impact on low-income communities of color. More than 76 percent of people who live in low-income communities of color live in nature-deprived places.</li>
